      <h3>Hello World</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I love #cccamp15. (and other festivals too)</li>
        <li>So much work wasted in setup and teardown.</li> 
        <li>I want to have festival lifestyle at all times.</li> 
        <li>Buying land in Portugal + setting up infrastructure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>I've to many places such as Ozora, Boom, Burning Man, Rainbow Gathering, Glastonbury and now #cccamp15. Having family - <a href="http://stefanow.net">stefanow.net</a> allows me to think longer term and fight for a better future of Gaia (born 2012) and Aura (born 2014). It would so nice if they were surrounded by other children and raised in a tribal / community / village spirit (you can think of "festival" in terms of "gathering of people driven by similar values").

      <h3>3 year vision</h3>
      <p>A few acres of land in Portugal (enough to learn and experiment). Own energy, water, waste treatment (see soil production at Boom Festival), permaculture, a lot of sun, warm climate, access to the ocean, favourable legal situation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>sun = energy</li>
        <li>ocean = water</li>
        <li>energy + water = fresh water</li>
        <li>fresh water + sun = plants</li>
        <li>plants = food</li>
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(off-the-grid vision in mind)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>10 year vision</h3>
      <p>Multiple locations: US, Goa, Bali, New Zealand, Réunion, Lanzarote, floating islands...</p>
      <p>Own currency, own passports, own sattelite network, own fiber optic underneath the ocean...</p>
      
      <h3>100 year vision</h3>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(there is one but you may say that I'm crazy so I'll leave it until we meet for a beer or two)</i></p><!-- you can always see git history for that matter -->

      <h3>Core values</h3>
      <ul class="values">
       <li>Strenght, Freedom, Independence (you join because you want)</li>
       <li>Be excellent to each other!</li>
       <li>Permaculture and automation (we employ nature and technology to do the hard work)</li>
       <li>Open-source from the ground-up (including legal documents - BTW - they should be 1 page long max)</li>
       <li>Using open-source software and open-source hardware (not being dependent on proprietary technologies)</li>
       <li>Communication protocols (being able to discuss 'tabu' such as ...,  money, relationships, ... - they don't teach that in school)</li>
       <li>We treat all the species well (animal exploitation on industrial scale is not cool)</li>
       <li>Healthy relationship with money (some high-yield remote work)</li>
       <li>Supportive environment to launch innovative projects</li>
       <li>Experimenting polyphasic sleep, brain hacking (nootropics) and peak performance</li>
       <li>RTFM - read the manual - all the information should be easily digestible by new members</li>
       <li>Commitment for longevity and creating long-lasting positive impact</li>
       <li>Adding value - WIN WIN WIN - it's more than 'zero sum' game</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>totalism.org + Hacking Housing</li><!-- sorry - no links in this section - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ - license does require me to do so - if a website visitor want to visit these sites there are search engines available out there -->

       <li>Auroville</li>
       <li>Tamera</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Help needed</h3>
  <p>Need to investigate form of ownership (Delaware Corporation / trust / non-profit / charity). Want to create structure much stronger than myself. </p>
  <p>I was thinking about Shamir's Secret Sharing - 100 parts of the private key - 51 pieces required to unlock the master key and make a decision. See also: Loomio, DemocracyOS, Liquid Democracy...</p>
  <p>Money is a tool that used wisely will allow us to setup proper infrastructure (reliable equipment) and allow for contingencies</p>
  <p>Considering crowdfunding campaign - 100 units - priced approximately ... each with some incentives for early members</p>
  <p>It's a constant work in progress... (need to research first)</p>
