	<p>Once upon a time a set myself a goal - after achieving it there was nowhere to go and I became depressed. I'm not going to make that mistake again.<p>

	<p>Currecntly I'm working in Central London  andI should be able to afford to buy the land in about 2.5 - 3 years, however I have an idea how to faciliate this process.</p>


	<p>I'll invest all my savings into renting a house and creating a highly-optimised hacker enviroment. I'll help you find well-paid gigs and provide for all your needs:
	<ul>
		<li>housing</li>
		<li>food</li>
		<li>super-fast internet</li>
		<li>you name it</li>
		<li>education</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>Be excellent to each other</p>
	<p>We are the culture</p>
	<p>we are the future</p>
	<p>The future is now</p>
	<p>Here and now</p>
